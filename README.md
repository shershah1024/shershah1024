I believe that I belong to a new group of coders/builders who are experts in their respective fields and are 
using AI to build applications to supercharge themselves and the community

I build practical products. My 'can-use-AI-for-this' radar is always on, and I am really quick to build something that I can personally use. 

Specialist in building voice AI agents and WhatsApp AI agents.
